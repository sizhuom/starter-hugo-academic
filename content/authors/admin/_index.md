I am a Research Scientist at {{< staticref "https://research.snap.com" "newtab" >}}Snap Research{{< /staticref >}}. My research interests lie in computer vision and computational imaging. I received my PhD in Computer Sciences at UW-Madison, advised by {{< staticref "https://wisionlab.cs.wisc.edu/people/mohit-gupta/" "newtab" >}}Professor Mohit Gupta{{< /staticref >}}. 

My PhD work focuses on solving geometry, motion-related computer vision problems using novel computational cameras. For example, how can we accurately recover minuscule motion of objects? How can we take a clear, sharp image of a extremely dark and moving scene? I develop novel solutions to these problems using light field cameras, structured light and single-photon cameras.
