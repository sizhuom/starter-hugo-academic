I am a PhD candidate at UW-Madison Wision Lab, advised by Professor Mohit Gupta. My research focuses on motion-related computer vision problems (e.g., scene flow, burst photography) from the perspective of novel camera design, including light field cameras, structured light and single-photon cameras.
